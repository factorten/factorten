- 👋 Hi, I’m @factorten
- 👀 Life is busy
- 🌱 I’m trying to learn everything all at once. I'll start something and then realise I need to learn more about something else. So far I've started Python, Linux, static web design, a bit of docker, and now git. I do more reading than doing.
- 🌈 I dream of setting up a home server, spinning up docker containers, and being able to access it all through something like Headscale.
- 💞️ I’ll collaborate on something when I'm competent enough!
